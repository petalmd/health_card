## Contributing

Here is a short definition-of-done list:

- everything must be tested with rspec
- most of [rubocop's styles](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) must be followed, within reason
- squash your commits before doing a pull request, see [this page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5189560/squash-my-last-x-commits-together-using-git) for more information
