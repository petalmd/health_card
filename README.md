# Health Card gem

Services and validations for government-issued health cards.

## Usage

In your _Gemfile_, add the following line:

`gem 'health_card', git: 'https://github.com/petalmd/health_card.git', branch:  'master'`

and then run `bundle install`. You will then have access to HealthCard's methods.

## Validators

A card value can be validated by means of the following methods:

### card_valid?, card_valid!

Validates the specified card value.

Usage:

`HealthCard.card_valid?(card_value, iso3166_code, options)`

Parameters:

- `card_value` (`String`): the card value to be validated.
- `iso3166_code` (`String`): the ISO 3166 code that represents the country or country subdivision against which the card value should be validated.
- `options` (`Hash`): extra informations about the card that may affect the card value's validation (eg. first and last name of the card bearer). Also contains the `skip_checksum` flag, which will tell the validator not to validate the checksum.

Return value:

`true` or `false`, whether the card value was determined to be valid or not.

Notes:

The `.card_valid!` version of the method will raise an `InvalidCardValueError` instead of returning `false`.

## Converters

A card value can be converted to other useful formats. The following methods are available:

### sanitize

Strips the specified card value to the bare minimum. Basically, it removes diacritics and all non-alphanumeric characters.

Usage:

`HealthCard.sanitize(card_value, iso3166_code)`

Parameters:

- `card_value` (`String`): the card value to be sanitized.
- `iso3166_code` (`String`): the ISO 3166 code that represents the country or country subdivision for which the card value should be sanitized.

Return value:

The stripped-down card value.

### beautify, beautify!

Formats the specified card value to how it would look like on an official card.

Usage:

`HealthCard.beautify(card_value, iso3166_code)`

Parameters:

- `card_value` (`String`): the card value to be beautified.
- `iso3166_code` (`String`): the ISO 3166 code that represents the country or country subdivision for which the card value should be displayed.

Return value:

The card value in the country or country subdivision's official format.

Notes:

This method validates the card value first. If the card value is not valid, it will not be changed. The `.beautify!` version of the method will raise an `InvalidCardValueError` instead.

## ISO 3166 codes

Available countries or country subdivisions are:

- CA-ON (Canada, Ontario)
- CA-QC (Canada, Quebec)
